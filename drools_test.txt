mvn clean package worked well

create 'patientData', {NAME => 'cf1', VERSIONS => 3, REPLICATION_SCOPE => 1, COMPRESSION => 'SNAPPY'}

hbase(main):006:0> list
TABLE                                                                           
patientData                                                                     
1 row(s) in 0.0730 seconds

=> ["patientData"]

worked after adding HBASE_MANAGES_ZK in hbase-env.sh and
restarting HDFS service and HBase services
